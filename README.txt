#---------------- NLLS ----------------#
#
# Python implementations for algorithms 
# to solve machine learning nonlinear
# least squares problems (NLLS)

# The algorithms of the article are 
# implemented in 
	
	SNLLS1.py (Rank-1 approximation)
	SNLLSL.py (Rank-L approximation)

# To run the experiments use the files

	SNLLS_1_IRISCLASS.py (EX 1)
	SNLLS_2_RANKING.py (EX 2)
	SNLLS_3_AUTOENCODE.py (EX 3)

# It may be that in SNLLS_2_RANKING.py 
# the programatic installations on 
# lines 73 and 76 are to be replaced
# by lines 78 and 79

Experiment outcomes are stored in /DATA
